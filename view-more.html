                        <h1 class="article-title">My Journey as a Devoloper</h1>
                        <p class="article-preview"> When I decided to dive into the world of web development, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of resources available. Should I go for YouTube tutorials, online courses, or bootcamps? After some research and recommendations, I stumbled upon Scrimbaâ€”and it just clicked for me.</p>
                        <img src="images/i6.png" class="scrimba-img">
                        <h3>Why I Chose Scrimba Over Other Platforms</h3>
                        <p>I explored other platforms before settling on Scrimba. Some of them had good video tutorials, but they lacked interactivity. Others required too much upfront commitment, like expensive subscriptions or lengthy bootcamps. Scrimba hit the sweet spot for me:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I could learn at my own pace.</li>
                            <li>It was engaging and hands-on.</li>
                            <li>The instructors explained concepts clearly and provided real-world examples.</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        <h3>My Goals When Starting</h3>
                        <p>When I started, my primary goal was to learn enough to build my own websites and eventually start freelancing. I wanted a platform that could guide me from beginner to confident developer, and Scrimba's structured learning path gave me a clear roadmap.</p>

                    <p class="article-preview">Learning JavaScript felt like stepping into a whole new dimension of web development. HTML and CSS were fun, but JavaScript? That's where the magic happened. It's the language that makes websites come alive.</p>

                    <p class="article-preview">One of the biggest challenges was debugging. Sometimes the layout wouldn't behave as expected, or the JavaScript code wouldn't work as intended. But each mistake taught me something new. When I finally deployed the site and opened it in a browser, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment.</p>

                    <h2 class="article-title">The Road So Far:</h2>
                    <p class="article-preview">This journey is far from overâ€”there's still so much to learn, from responsive design to frameworks like React. But now, I feel equipped with a strong foundation and the tools to continue growing.
                     To anyone considering learning web development, I'd say: just start. Take it one step at a time, celebrate every small win, and remember that every expert was once a beginner.
