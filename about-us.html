                        <p class="about-info">A few months ago, I decided to dive into the world of coding. I didn't have any prior experience, but I was eager to learn how websites are built, how they work behind the scenes, and how I could create something meaningful on the web. Along the way, I discovered Scrimba, an interactive learning platform that made the process both fun and approachable.</p>

                        <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                        <p>When I first started learning web development, the idea of building websites and writing code felt overwhelming. But with time, patience, and the right toolsâ€”like Scrimbaâ€”I began to understand the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What once felt impossible turned into something I look forward to every day: creating, learning, and growing as a developer.</p>
                        <h3>Let's Connect and Create Together!</h3>
                        <p>This is more than just a personal diaryâ€”it's a place to celebrate progress, embrace challenges, and inspire one another. I hope my journey will motivate you to start or continue yours. Feel free to reach out, share your story, or ask questions. Let's keep learning and building together! ðŸš€</p>

                    <p class="article-preview">Learning JavaScript felt like stepping into a whole new dimension of web development. HTML and CSS were fun, but JavaScript? That's where the magic happened. It's the language that makes websites come alive.</p>

                    <p class="article-preview">One of the biggest challenges was debugging. Sometimes the layout wouldn't behave as expected, or the JavaScript code wouldn't work as intended. But each mistake taught me something new. When I finally deployed the site and opened it in a browser, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment.</p>

                    <h2 class="article-title">The Road So Far:</h2>
                    <p class="article-preview">This journey is far from overâ€”there's still so much to learn, from responsive design to frameworks like React. But now, I feel equipped with a strong foundation and the tools to continue growing.
                     To anyone considering learning web development, I'd say: just start. Take it one step at a time, celebrate every small win, and remember that every expert was once a beginner.
