                        <p class="article-preview"> When I decided to dive into the world of web development, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of resources available. Should I go for YouTube tutorials, online courses, or bootcamps? After some research and recommendations, I stumbled upon Scrimbaâ€”and it just clicked for me.<br><span class="center">I couldn't wait to see where this journey would take me!</span></p>

                    <p class="article-preview">Starting with HTML felt like discovering the building blocks of the web. I learned that HTML is what gives a webpage its structureâ€”like the skeleton of a website. Through Scrimba, I learned how to create headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</p>

                    <p class="article-preview">After learning HTML, I was ready to add some life to my pages with CSS. I'll admit, CSS felt a bit tricky at firstâ€”understanding the box model and figuring out why things didn't align the way I expected was challenging. But Scrimba's interactive lessons made it manageable.</p>

                    <p class="article-preview">Learning JavaScript felt like stepping into a whole new dimension of web development. HTML and CSS were fun, but JavaScript? That's where the magic happened. It's the language that makes websites come alive.</p>

                    <p class="article-preview">One of the biggest challenges was debugging. Sometimes the layout wouldn't behave as expected, or the JavaScript code wouldn't work as intended. But each mistake taught me something new. When I finally deployed the site and opened it in a browser, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment.</p>

                    <p class="article-preview">This journey is far from overâ€”there's still so much to learn, from responsive design to frameworks like React. But now, I feel equipped with a strong foundation and the tools to continue growing.
                     To anyone considering learning web development, I'd say: just start. Take it one step at a time, celebrate every small win, and remember that every expert was once a beginner.
